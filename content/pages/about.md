# About PonyFest Online!

Right! We know what you’re thinking: What the _hay_ is PonyFest Online? Where did you come from? This wasn’t a thing a week ago!

You’d be right! PonyFest Online is an online Pony Convention with a one week turnaround - Our entire organization, schedule,
everything has been built this week! We were inspired by Ruef’s awesome [online Vendor Hall](bit.ly/SupportVendors) for our
friends and family who’ve been directly hurt by the loss of in-person pony conventions.

PonyFest Online is a celebration of our community, a space for us to come together in challenging times and find a way to love,
live, and laugh together while we’re all indoors keeping each other safe.

We’re going to present a full day including:
1. A vendor hall for you to buy awesome things and support our amazing content creators!
2. A full Mane Events panel schedule from 10 AM - 3 AM EST with awesome VIPs & Community Guests!
3. Video Gaming & Tabletop spaces with both official events as well as encouraging everyone to run their own games and play together!
4. An artist showcase multistream on Picarto from Noon - 9 PM EST!
5. Open chat & voice channels for community-driven content

This Saturday, come join us and spend all day with your fellow friends and fans! Together, we’ll once again demonstrate that Friendship is Magic!
