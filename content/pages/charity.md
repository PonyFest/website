## Bidding Instructions

To participate in our auction, join us on the [PonyFest Discord](https://discord.gg/ponyfest) at 2:30pm EDT on Saturday
and follow these steps!

1. Put on our stream on [Bit Rate's Stage](https://ponyfest.horse/bit-rates-stage) and join us in the #bit-rates-stage to watch the auction
happening!
2. To actually bid on an item, we have a separate channel called #charity-auction, where our lovely and helpful
Neural Net waits for your generous input!
3. Type `!bid` and a money amount to bid on the currently available auction item, for example `!bid 30.00`
to bid 30 dollars. Your bid will be accepted as long as it’s higher than the previous highest
amount for that item by at least dollar!
4. Keep bidding and having fun until the item is closed for auctioning - The bidder with the highest amount at that
point wins!
5. If you are the winner, you then head right over to our fundraiser for NAMI and donate the winning amount.
PLEASE absolutely make sure to include your Discord nickname and the won item’s name in your donation message!! This is
necessary to identify you as the winner! If you forgot to include the name in your donation message, then please take a
screenshot of your successful donation and DM it to @Perrydotto#7397 on Discord.
6. Once your donation has been properly confirmed, we will put you in touch with the kind provider of the won item, and
the rest will be handled between you and them.
