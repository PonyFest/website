Right! We know what you’re thinking: What the hay is PonyFest Online? Where did you come from? This wasn’t a thing a week ago!
You’d be right! PonyFest Online is an online Pony Convention with a one week turnaround - Our entire organization, schedule, everything has been built this week! We were inspired by Ruef’s awesome online Vendor Hall for our friends and family who’ve been directly hurt by the loss of in-person pony conventions.</description></item><item><title>Charity Concert T-Shirt</title><link>https://ponyfest.horse/shirt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ponyfest.horse/shirt/</guid><description>Charity T-Shirt
#shirt-ad img { border-radius: 10px; max-width: 100%; } For the PonyFest × PVFM Concert, we have another fantastic concert shirt AND a powerful charity attached!
Our charity this time around is The Trevor Project, the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ youth. Providing free counseling over chat, phone, and text as well as doing important advocacy and activist work, Trevor Project has supported gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, gender-nonconforming, and questioning young people across the entire United States since 1998.</description></item><item><title>Guests</title><link>https://ponyfest.horse/guests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ponyfest.horse/guests/</guid><description>Guests Koa Hiya, I'm Koa!
I'm a yellow pega gremlin that makes music in a number of styles and doodles a whole bunch of bright, expressive horses (among other things). I'm always excited to connect with folks via my creative pursuits, and look forward to getting to do so again through PonyFest 6.0!
