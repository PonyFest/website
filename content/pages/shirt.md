For our charity effort, PonyFest presents something a little different this time - A shirt fundraiser! To support our
cause, simply buy our fabulous concert shirt at our CustomInk fundraiser. All profits go directly to our charity, the
[Coalition For The Homeless in New York](https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/about-cfh/), and you receive some super
neat PonyFest merch, as designed by the fantastic [Techycutie](https://techycutie.com). Everyone wins!

However, there is a small catch - To make sure that these shirts get printed, we need to sell at least 30 in total.
After that, the sky's the limit, and every cent helps people in real need. Bring some hype and spread the word, so we
can make these shirts a reality!

## Q&A

**Q: Does the shirt come in a different fit?**

A: Unfortunately not! We offer the shirt at a unisex fit, avaible in sizes YXS to 4XL. Please check out the fundraiser page for a more detailed sizing guide!
