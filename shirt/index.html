Providing free counseling over chat, phone, and text as well as doing important advocacy and activist work, Trevor Project has supported gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, gender-nonconforming, and questioning young people across the entire United States since 1998. Their counseling services are available 24/7 and staffed by trained volunteers and experts.</p><p>Particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, the risk for LGBTQ+ youth to lose safety nets, become homeless, get abused, or be otherwise at high risk of personal crisis has increased massively. All money benefiting The Trevor Project will go directly into providing crucial resources and crisis support for youth in need.</p><span style=font-size:xx-large><p><a href=https://www.customink.com/fundraising/ponyfest-pvfm-concert-2022>Buy the shirts on CustomInk!</a></p></span><h2 id=qa>Q&A</h2><p><strong>Q: Are there only 100 shirts available?</strong></p><p>A: No, there are an infinite number of shirts to be had! 100 is just an initial goal, and one we would very much like to beat!</p><p><strong>Q: Do these shirts ship internationally?</strong></p><p>A: Yes!
