        "Desc": "One of the few Bronies left in Finland who didnâ€™t move on to the Anime- or Furry Fandom. In 2020 he decided to take a more active part in the music side of the fandom of which he had always been an avid listener, by both picking up DJing, performing at various online events, and co-founding an online pony music festival. You can expect to hear either sets filled with Drum and Bass or sets going through various electronic genres, usually getting faster as it goes on.",

        "Desc": "For those of you who don't know him, BeatSpark is a turquoise Unicorn that hails from the Upside Down land of Australia, who often calls people \"bean\" instead of their actual names and is all around a friend to all. He first joined the fandom back in 2018 when he was introduced by a close friend, also having found out about musicians like Budzy, Glaze, The Living Tombstone, Silva Hound etc. around the same time, with his eventual start on music production towards the halfway point of 2019. (BeatSpark also tried his hand at DJing around then, but never actually started to invest time in such until recently.) Since then, he's had the privilege to be able to meet so many new people and in time call them his friends and create content for others to enjoy; With the show and the fandom to thank for it. BeatSpark hopes that he can keep the Magic of Friendship alive and kicking for years to come, and most importantly, he'll be doing it for y'all! <3",
