# About PonyFest Online!

What the _hay_ is PonyFest Online?

PonyFest Online started in 2020 as an online Pony Convention with a one-week turnaround to survive Covid - Our entire organization, schedule, everything was built in a week! We were inspired to create an online Vendor Hall for our friends and family who were hurt by the loss of in-person pony conventions.

Since then, PonyFest Online has grown to host multiple conventions and concerts over the years as a celebration of our community. A space for us to come together regardless of distance from one another and find a way to love, live, and laugh together.
