He first joined the fandom back in 2018 when he was introduced by a close friend, also having found out about musicians like Budzy, Glaze, The Living Tombstone, Silva Hound etc. around the same time, with his eventual start on music production towards the halfway point of 2019. (BeatSpark also tried his hand at DJing around then, but never actually started to invest time in such until recently.) Since then, he's had the privilege to be able to meet so many new people and in time call them his friends and create content for others to enjoy; With the show and the fandom to thank for it. BeatSpark hopes that he can keep the Magic of Friendship alive and kicking for years to come, and most importantly, he'll be doing it for y'all! <3</p><p class=guest-links style=margin:5px><a href=https://linktr.ee/BeatSpark>Linktree</a></p></div><div class="text-box guest-" style=margin-bottom:20px;text-align:left><h1>Tw3lv3</h1><p><img src=/images/guests/tw3lv3.png style=max-height:350px;max-width:250px;float:left;padding-right:1.25em;padding-bottom:1.25em>I'm a belgian Producer/DJ known for my collabs with Koa, General Mumble MC-Arch, Drummershy etc. I mainly produce Liquid Drum&Bass and Lo-Fi but I also made other genres.
