For the PonyFest × PVFM Concert, we have another fantastic concert shirt AND a powerful charity attached!

Our charity this time around is The Trevor Project, the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ youth. Providing free counseling over chat, phone, and text as well as doing important advocacy and activist work, Trevor Project has supported gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, gender-nonconforming, and questioning young people across the entire United States since 1998. Their counseling services are available 24/7 and staffed by trained volunteers and experts.

Particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, the risk for LGBTQ+ youth to lose safety nets, become homeless, get abused, or be otherwise at high risk of personal crisis has increased massively. All money benefiting The Trevor Project will go directly into providing crucial resources and crisis support for youth in need.
