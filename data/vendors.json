For the total cost of... Dun dun dunnn... 6 Euros! It includes everything, the postcard, the labor and the shipping cost!\nFor an additional euro I will add a non pony sticker, either randomly or from the selection of  27 different stickers (woo!)\nEach additional postcard/sticker/drawing will cost 1 Euro to the original price. You may ask me to remove the drawing and just send you the postcard, which will reduce 1 Euro from the original price.\n\n~Twitch Stream commissions~\nFrom a dumb sketch to a nice profile picture, I can draw it all! \nThe prices vary from 3 Euros for a silly sketch, to a 35 Euro of a fullbody drawing in the most complicated shading style possible. \n\nYou may look at all the prices available, if you mess around with this form: \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKqpUvwLjZVwnDsJInZ1EQ3UMHg2ulJ2sn_Th1whss4WwqWw/viewform\n\nI highy recommend checking out the lineless section and get the smooth shaded icon (or any of the lineless icons), they look AMAZING on your profile picture!\n\nAnyway, everyone, have a good con!",
