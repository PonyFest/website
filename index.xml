Right! We know what you’re thinking: What the hay is PonyFest Online? Where did you come from? This wasn’t a thing a week ago!
You’d be right! PonyFest Online is an online Pony Convention with a one week turnaround - Our entire organization, schedule, everything has been built this week! We were inspired by Ruef’s awesome online Vendor Hall for our friends and family who’ve been directly hurt by the loss of in-person pony conventions.</description></item><item><title>Guests</title><link>https://ponyfest.horse/guests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ponyfest.horse/guests/</guid><description>Musicians 4EverfreeBrony Hey, I'm Garrison, or 4EverfreeBrony. Been a musician in the fandom for about 7 years now. Love ponies, and I love music. I'd like to thank the guys at PonyFest for putting on this awesome event, and for inviting me to perform. Let's have a great show!
