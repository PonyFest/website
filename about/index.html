friends and family who’ve been directly hurt by the loss of in-person pony conventions.</p><p>PonyFest Online is a celebration of our community, a space for us to come together in challenging times and find a way to love,
live, and laugh together while we’re all indoors keeping each other safe.</p><p>We’re going to present a full day including:</p><ol><li>A vendor hall for you to buy awesome things and support our amazing content creators!</li><li>A full Mane Events panel schedule from 10 AM - 3 AM EST with awesome VIPs & Community Guests!</li><li>Video Gaming & Tabletop spaces with both official events as well as encouraging everyone to run their own games and play together!</li><li>An artist showcase multistream on Picarto from Noon - 9 PM EST!</li><li>Open chat & voice channels for community-driven content</li></ol><p>This Saturday, come join us and spend all day with your fellow friends and fans!
